ReXGlue converts Xbox 360 PowerPC code into portable C++ that runs natively on modern platforms.

ReXGlue is heavily rooted on the foundations of [Xenia](https://github.com/xenia-project), the Xbox 360 emulator. Rather than interpreting or JIT-compiling PPC instructions at runtime, ReXGlue takes a different path: it generates C++ source code ahead of time, an approach inspired by [XenonRecomp](https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenonRecomp) and [rexdex's recompiler](https://github.com/rexdex/recompiler).

Latest SDK builds and releases are published on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk/releases). Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/CNTxwSNZfT) for updates and share what you have created.

## Very Special Thank You:
- [Project Xenia](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/tree/master/src/xenia) - Their invaluable work on Xbox 360 emulation laid the groundwork for ReXGlue's development. This project (and numerous others) would not exist without their hard work and dedication.
- [XenonRecomp](https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenonRecomp) - For pioneering the modern static recompilation approach for Xbox 360. A lot of the codegen analysis logic and instruction translations are based on their work. Thank you!
- [rexdex's recompiler](https://github.com/rexdex/recompiler) - The OG static recompiler for Xbox 360. 
- Many others in the Xbox 360 homebrew and modding communities whose work and research have contributed to the collective knowledge that makes projects like this possible.
